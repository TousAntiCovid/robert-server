## CLEA coding guidelines

* Contributions are done through Merge Requests on the develop branch (gitflow). MR must be reviewed by another dev than
  the code author. a MR can be merged when approved by at least one reviewer.
* Development happens on feature branches.
* Commit often, small commits, and publish them on the central repositories to share the lastest developments with the
  dev team.
* Tests are run as part of the CI pipeline and should stay "green"
* Use Meaningful names (very important): classes, methods, variables
* Unit test the code
* Small methods
* Methods do one thing, only one level of abstraction
* DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
* SOLID
    * S: Single-responsibility principle: a class should only have a single responsibility, that is, only changes to one
      part of the software's specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.
    * O: Openâ€“closed principle: "software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
    * L: Liskov substitution principle: "objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes
      without altering the correctness of that program."
    * I: Interface segregation principle: "many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose
      interface."
    * D: Dependency inversion principle: "depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."
* Comments
    * Do not paraphrase the code. Make the code self-documentating.
    * Comment only what is not obvious by reading the code: informative comment, explanation of intent, warning. Use
      javadoc for public APIs.
* Formatting
    * Naming conventions: Camel case.
    * Unit of indentation is 4 spaces. No use of the tab character.
    * Curly braces at the end of the line that starts the class, method, loop, etc., and the closing brace is on a line
      by itself, lined up vertically with the start of the first line.

## Kafka SSL Setup
This section explains how to configure secure SSL communication between consumer/producer and kafka server.

We need to generate a certificate for our Kafka server (with CN = hostname). The certificate will be stored into a truststore (jks format) and protected by a password.

To generate a store in `jks` format, you can use the following instructions:

```sh
openssl pkcs12 -inkey node-1.pem -in node-1.pem -name node-1 -export -out node-1.p12
keytool -importkeystore -deststorepass changeme \
    -destkeystore node-1-keystore.jks -srckeystore node-1.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12
```
Truststore has to be installed on the filesystem of servers hosting Kafka producers / consumers, i.e. clea-ws-rest and clea-venue-consumer apps.

Kafka SSL configuration will be stored in Vault and injected through spring-cloud-vault-config-consul in apps.
Here are the properties to inject into Kafka producers and consumers apps:
- `spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers` has to be set to the hostname:port of the kafka server (same name as the CN of the certificate)
- `spring.kafka.properties.security.protocol` with value `ssl` to enable SSL
- `spring.kafka.ssl.trust-store-location` with value `file:///path/to/kafka.client.truststore.jks` (do not forget the `file://` prefix for a valid URL)
- `spring.kafka.ssl.trust-store-password`
